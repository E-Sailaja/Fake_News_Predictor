# Fake_News_Predictor
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using a logistic regression algorithm. It includes data preprocessing, stemming, TF-IDF vectorization, and model evaluation. The main goal is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify potentially misleading news content.
